# ðŸ¦€ CSC101 â€“ Learning Rust

This repository contains all my Rust programming practice and projects completed as part of CSC101 (Introduction to Computer Science). These files represent my journey learning the Rust programming language â€” from basic syntax to problem-solving, file I/O, and building simple CLI applications.

## ðŸ“š What's Inside

This repo includes:

- ðŸ”¤ **Basic Rust syntax** â€“ variables, loops, conditionals, functions
- ðŸ§® **Math & logic exercises**
- ðŸ“‚ **File operations**
- ðŸ§µ **Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes**
- ðŸ“¦ **Mini-projects** â€“ including CLI tools and simple games
- ðŸ§ª **Code experiments** â€“ trying out concepts like enums, structs, and pattern matching

## ðŸš€ Why Rust?

Rust is known for its:
- Safety-first memory management
- High performance
- Growing popularity in systems programming and web backends (e.g., via WebAssembly, Rocket, Actix)

This course gave me a foundation in programming with Rust, and I used it to sharpen my logic, problem-solving, and low-level understanding of how code works.


## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Core Rust syntax and logic flow
- Understanding the ownership model and borrow checker
- Pattern matching, enums, structs
- Working with the Rust compiler and Cargo
- Building terminal-based apps from scratch

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

As I continue learning, Iâ€™ll be:
- Building larger Rust applications
- Exploring asynchronous Rust
- Learning frameworks like Actix, Rocket, or Tauri
